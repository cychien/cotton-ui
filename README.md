# Cotton UI

Cotton UI is a component library featuring progressively enhanced components. 

These components can function even before hydration and automatically transform into more complete versions when JavaScript loads in. The whole process ensures there's no disruption to users or negative impact on user experience.

Cotton UI offers 2 different versions of any components:

- Styled version: For people who want to build fast. We use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) style.
- Headless version: For people who want to customize a lot.
